		We all come across sayings and proverbs that stick and inspire us at a deeper level. I collect such quotes and keep them here
		as a reference for myself to visit and read when I feel I need to be reminded by the wisdom of great people. (I also included a few that belong to me)
		</p><br>
		
		<p class="quoteText">"That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else"<span style="font-weight: bold;"><i> - Charlie Chaplin</i></span></p>
		
		<p class="quoteText">"You pile up enough tomorrows, and you'll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays"<span style="font-weight: bold;"><i> - Prof. Harold Hill</i></span></p>

		<p class="quoteText">"True art and virtue cannot develop in an environment where goodness and honesty are lost. No one has learned to be human by memorizing the Pythagorean theorem. What is as indispensable to a person's development as breathing is, first of all, high human values. Everything else comes after that. Where there is no sound morality, science degenerates."<span style="font-weight: bold;"><i> - Dr. Bedri Ruhselman (translated from Turkish original)</i></span></p>

		<p class="quoteText">"Risk is what's left over when you think you've thought of everything"<span style="font-weight: bold;"><i> - Carl Richards</i></span></p>
		
		<p class="quoteText">"The great paradox of the brain is that everything you know about the world is provided to you by an organ that has itself never seen that world. The brain exists in silence and darkness, like a dungeoned prisoner. It has no pain receptors, literally no feelings. It has never felt warm sunshine or a soft breeze. To your brain, the world is just a stream of electrical pulses, like taps of Morse code. And out of this bare and neutral information it creates for you-quite literally creates- a vibrant, three-dimensional, sensually engaging universe. Your brain is you. Everything else is just plumbing and scaffolding"<span style="font-weight: bold;"><i> - Bill Bryson</i></span></p>

		<p class="quoteText">"Sometimes God hides how he punishes a person who has done you wrong. For since you are only human, you may submit to your ego and say 'that served him right', which seeds disorder within you. Instead, he sorts it out out of sight afar from you. Sometimes he prolongs the process to make you forget. Then he gives the collective punishment to that person after many years. You cannot know who deserves what in what scale. Not knowing saves you from waiting in ambush. That way you only fight to become a better person"<span style="font-weight: bold;"><i> - Unknown</i></span></p>
		
		<p class="quoteText">"Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something"<span style="font-weight: bold;"><i> - Plato</i></span></p>
